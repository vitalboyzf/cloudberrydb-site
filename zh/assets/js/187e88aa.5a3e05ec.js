Firstly, if a ",(0,i.jsx)(t.code,{children:"NOTIFY"})," is executed inside a transaction, the notify events are not delivered until and unless the transaction is committed. This is appropriate, since if the transaction is aborted, all the commands within it have had no effect, including ",(0,i.jsx)(t.code,{children:"NOTIFY"}),'. But it can be disconcerting if one is expecting the notification events to be delivered immediately. Secondly, if a listening session receives a notification signal while it is within a transaction, the notification event will not be delivered to its connected client until just after the transaction is completed (either committed or aborted). Again, the reasoning is that if a notification were delivered within a transaction that was later aborted, one would want the notification to be undone somehow \u2014 but the server cannot "take back" a notification once it has sent it to the client.
