With a unique index, Cloudberry Database checks the unique constraint when data is inserted into the AO table to ensure the uniqueness of the data. At the same time, the database optimizes specific queries with the optimizer to improve the query performance. However, this also brings some overhead for maintaining a unique index, especially when inserting data.","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/index":{"id":"releases/index","title":"Releases","description":"","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.5.0":{"id":"releases/release-1.5.0","title":"1.5.0","description":"\u7248\u672c\u53f7\uff1av1.5.0","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.5.1":{"id":"releases/release-1.5.1","title":"1.5.1","description":"\u7248\u672c\u53f7\uff1av1.5.1","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.5.2":{"id":"releases/release-1.5.2","title":"1.5.2","description":"\u7248\u672c\u53f7\uff1av1.5.2","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.5.3":{"id":"releases/release-1.5.3","title":"1.5.3","description":"\u7248\u672c\u53f7: v1.5.3","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.5.4":{"id":"releases/release-1.5.4","title":"1.5.4","description":"\u7248\u672c\u53f7\uff1av1.5.4","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.6.0":{"id":"releases/release-1.6.0","title":"1.6.0","description":"\u7248\u672c\u53f7\uff1av1.6.0","sidebar":"docsbars"},"security/client-auth":{"id":"security/client-auth","title":"Configure Client Authentication","description":"This topic explains how to configure client connections and authentication for Cloudberry Database.","sidebar":"docsbars"},"security/configure-row-level-security-policy":{"id":"security/configure-row-level-security-policy","title":"Configure Row-Level Security Policy","description":"Row-level security (RLS) policy allows the table owner to define access policies that control users\' access to specific rows of the table.
