HashJoin builds a hash table based on the join key to match the join key, which might cause a memory access bottleneck and disk bottleneck. RuntimeFilter is an optimization technique that generates filters in real-time during HashJoin operations, which can pre-filter data before executing HashJoin to speed up HashJoin operations. In some scenarios, the RuntimeFilter optimization can double execution efficiency.","sidebar":"docsbars"},"performance/use-unique-index-on-ao-tables":{"id":"performance/use-unique-index-on-ao-tables","title":"Create Unique Index on AO Table","description":"Starting from v1.5.0, you can create a unique index on an Append-Optimized (AO) or Append-Optimized Column Store (AOCS) table in Cloudberry Database. With a unique index, Cloudberry Database checks the unique constraint when data is inserted into the AO table to ensure the uniqueness of the data. At the same time, the database optimizes specific queries with the optimizer to improve the query performance. However, this also brings some overhead for maintaining a unique index, especially when inserting data.","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/index":{"id":"releases/index","title":"Releases","description":"","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.5.0":{"id":"releases/release-1.5.0","title":"1.5.0","description":"This is not an Apache release!","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.5.1":{"id":"releases/release-1.5.1","title":"1.5.1","description":"This is not an Apache release!","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.5.2":{"id":"releases/release-1.5.2","title":"1.5.2","description":"This is not an Apache release!","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.5.3":{"id":"releases/release-1.5.3","title":"1.5.3","description":"This is not an Apache release!","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.5.4":{"id":"releases/release-1.5.4","title":"1.5.4","description":"This is not an Apache release!","sidebar":"docsbars"},"releases/release-1.6.0":{"id":"releases/release-1.6.0","title":"1.6.0","description":"This is not an Apache release!","sidebar":"docsbars"},"security/client-auth":{"id":"security/client-auth","title":"Configure Client Authentication","description":"This topic explains how to configure client connections and authentication for Apache Cloudberry.","sidebar":"docsbars"},"security/configure-row-level-security-policy":{"id":"security/configure-row-level-security-policy","title":"Configure Row-Level Security Policy","description":"Row-level security (RLS) policy allows the table owner to define access policies that control users\' access to specific rows of the table.
